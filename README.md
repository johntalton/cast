A nice ray tracer with some bells and whistles.

- Worker based
- JSON definitions
- Wide range of Objects and CSG
- UV Mapping
- Single ray debugging

## JSON World definition

JSON world definition including multiple cameras per scene and expressive definitions.

## CSG (constructed solid geometry)

Union, Intersection and Difference from the full set of objects bellow.

Opening the door to create a wide range of otherwise complex shapes
